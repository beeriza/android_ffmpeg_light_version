# This script will automates the steps used to producing a static win32
# package of SoX.
#
# It is used on a Fedora box with mingw cross compiler and wine to
# test.  It can also be used under MSYS but will not generate PDF docs.
#
# It will optionally package up VC++ version of wget if found in
# ../wget-1.11.4.
#
# Various notes:
#
# Script makes use of "-static" option to tell compiler to prefer static
# external libraries so that we do not need to distribute DLL's.
#
# Libtool will get confused with this flag for external libraries
# that have a libtool lib*.la file and support shared libraries as
# well as static libraries (but usually only if that library
# further depends on other external libraries with lib*.la files).
# Libtool may ignore -static option or it may link first external
# library as static but other dependent libraries as shared (usually
# because it follows $dependency_libs and that ignores -static option).
#
# Work arounds include to only install static libraries, delete the lib*.la
# file, or edit the lib*.la file and set dlnames and library_names variables
# to empty string ("").
#
# The following command lines were used to generate the static external
# libraries SoX ships with.
#
# cd libtool-2.2.6b
# mingw32-configure --disable-shared --enable-static;mingw32-make;sudo mingw32-make install
#
# libpng.la will have libtool issue because depends on libz
# which has a libz.la file.  Must edit libpng.la to
# prevent needing to distribute zlib1.dll.
# cd libpng-1.2.41
# mingw32-configure --disable-shared --enable-static;mingw32-make;sudo mingw32-make install
#
# MINGW work around: had to comment out "cli" from SUBDIR.
# cd ../wavpack-4.60.1
# mingw32-configure --disable-shared --enable-static;mingw32-make;sudo mingw32-make install
#
# MINGW fixes for FLAC: Needed to edit include/share/alloc.h and remove
# !defined __MINGW32__ check so that stdint.h is included.
# Edited Makefile and removed "examples" from SUBDIRS.
# cd ../flac-1.2.1
# mingw32-configure --disable-shared --enable-static;mingw32-make;sudo mingw32-make install
#
# cd ../libogg-1.3.0

# mingw32-configure --disable-shared --enable-static;mingw-32-make;sudo mingw32-make install
#
# Compile libsndfile after FLAC and ogg vorbis so that it will include
# support for that.
# MINGW work around: Can either add -lwsock32 to end of *_LDADD for any
# failed program links or modify top leve Makefile and remove
# "programs", "examples", "regtests", and "tests" from SUBDIRS.
# cd ../libsndfile-1.0.25
